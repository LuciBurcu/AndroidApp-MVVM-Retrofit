# Android Application using Retrofit and LiveData in MVVM architectural pattern

Simple Android Application that performs CRUD operations using a backend server.

Backend server can be found in my other repository: https://github.com/LuciBurcu/Simple-REST-API-Kotlin-Spring

If the backend is not available/a problem arises, the operations will log an error.

**GET** operation -> press the refresh icon ( called on app open by default )

**CREATE** operation -> press the add icon

**UPDATE** operation -> long touch on an item

**DELETE** operation -> swipe to delete
